PROJECT TITLE: Project 2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: There are two ways to run the project. 

1) The user view. To use this, run the main method in the Clock class. This opens the terminal
and gives the user instructions on how to play the game. Once all the inputs are done, the
simulation will run. When the round is over, the number of ticks it took to complete, the final score,
and the most productive member in the game.

2) Through the experiment controller. The input file found in the project folder specifies different
trials. The four numbers represent the number of Walkers, Miners, Builders, and Miners. Each
trial runs 3 times, and the result is put into an Excel file as CSV.
